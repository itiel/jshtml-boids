# JS+HMTL Boids

An JS+HTML implementation of [Craig Raynold's Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) Algorithm. This is one in a series of implementations of the algorithm.

## How to Run It

Some parameters work through submiting a form and refreshing the page. That's why it would be best for `index.html` to be served.

You may, for instance, serve it using Python's HTTP server like so:

```python
python -m http.server
```

Then, you may visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) on you browser of choice.
